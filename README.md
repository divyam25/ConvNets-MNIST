# ConvNets-MNIST
Applying Deep Convolutional Layers on the popular MNIST dataset for recognising Hand-written digits. <br />
Will be experimenting with various layer architectures to come up with the best accuracy. <br />
<br/> Best Model as of now -- <br/> <br/>
2 Conv2D layers + MaxPool + 2 Conv2D layers + Max pool + 2 Dense Layers (with a dropout) <br/>
Accuracy -- 98.94% <br/> <br/>
